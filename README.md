I, <ins>Peter Edison</ins>, (henceforth known as **LESSOR**) having full legal and financial responsibility for this vessel, <ins>V-0E5</ins> d/b/a <ins>Mendicant Avenger</ins>, registered as a <ins>Salvage Tug</ins> operating out of <ins>Qincheng Station</ins>, being the ~~somewhat~~ lawful lessor and operator of *blah blah blah*

It's done.

AMF.

Jackpot! A (mostly) complete RCS package, a pair of remass bottles, and a fire extinguisher. Good condition, too; good enough for the yards at least. Hope it's enough. The hold is mostly full; I grabbed some loose parts and plating on the way out. You never know when you'll need them.

I think I'm far enough from the hulk that I can get a few hours rest in transit without worrying about NASS.

Picked over as I expected. Still, pried a seat and a crate out from under an imploded wall section. The crate had bits of EVA gear inside so I took it, crate and all. No idea why I grabbed the seat but it fit in the hold. You never know when you'll need one.

Heading inbound. The batteries are a few ticks above marginal but they'll hold. Plenty of O2 and remass and nothing between here and OKLG. Back in a few.

The honeymoon is officially over. That's 2K just gone. The NASS patrol boat clamped on before I had a chance -- to do *what* exactly? Run? Fight? Just play it cool and kill them with kindness. Swore I was on a urgent resupply mission with the RCS system but they didn't buy it. Tried to mitigate by admitting the ship was out of spec and that I'd have it overhauled after this run (technically true). Nope; 2K for unauthorized salvage. Hope I break even on this haul; not looking great.

Also, it's getting cold.

How the hell is it even Saturday?

Day 3: I've missed two payments already and today has to be the day. Pineda has a contact on OKLG she says can help me unload some of this gear. Problem is, she only told me where to meet - no name, no description. *"Just go to the bar; they'll find you. And be nice."* I've been stationside an hour and I don't see a bar anywhere.

__Where is the bar, Olive?__

`22:48:21`

I cannot get the time of day from `anyone` at OKLG. We've all been staring into hard vacuum too long. I really need a drink.

`23:04:52`

There's a monorail. *How do you hide a monorail?*

Note to self: Triple-check the TEC gas fraction monitor and the O2 regulator. Sweep for N2 leaks again after selling the bottles and RCS package.

I must be breathing propellant; that's the only way it makes sense.

This better be worth it.

`23:09:17`

How many bars are on OKLG anyway? Nothing to do but nurse this drink and hit every bar on the station. I'll either find a buyer or wind up drunk. Hopefully both.

Pineda, I thought we were friends.
